```lrc
[00:01.09] I was wrong to say I loved her, I was wrong to think I'm right
[00:06.73] When I told her it was over, oh my darling I had lied
[00:12.95] I've been running from my demons, afraid to look behind
[00:19.24] I've been running from myself, afraid of what I'd find
[00:46.24] 
[00:27.28] But how am I supposed to love you when I don't love who I am?
[00:33.53] And how could I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?
[00:39.32] 'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning, so let go of my hand
[00:45.94] Oh how can I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?
[01:14.44] 
[00:53.20] And now I'm stuck in this hotel room by a cold neon light
[00:59.48] And I've been waiting for an answer, but it won't come tonight
[01:05.57] And every bottle I have stolen lay shattered on the floor
[01:12.22] What's broken can't be whole anymore
[01:30.22] 
[01:20.43] But how am I supposed to love you when I don't love who I am?
[01:26.52] And how could I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?
[01:32.31] 'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning, so let go of my hand
[01:39.09] Oh how can I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?
[02:07.59] 
[01:46.81] And no one can ever hurt me like I hurt myself
[01:55.83] 'Cause I'm made out of stone
[01:58.37] And I'm beyond help, don't give your heart to me
[02:22.37] 
[02:13.45] But how am I supposed to love you when I don't love who I am?
[02:19.52] And how could I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?
[02:25.42] 'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning, so let go of my hand
[02:32.08] Oh how can I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?
[03:00.58] 
[02:40.49] Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
