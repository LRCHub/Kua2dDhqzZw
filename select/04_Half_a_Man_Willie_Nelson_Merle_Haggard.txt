If I only had one arm to hold you well better yet if I had none at all
Then I wouldn't have two arms that ache for you
And I'd have one less mem'ry to recall
If I only had one ear to listen to the lies that you told to me
Then I would more closely resemble the half a man that you've made of me.

And if I only had one leg to stand on
Then how much how much truer picture you'd see
And then I would more closely resamble the half of man
That you've made of me
Yeah, then I would more closely resamble the half of man
That you've made of me...
