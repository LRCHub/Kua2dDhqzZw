Shooting streams of colour, filtering the noise
Glimpses of the reflection staring back at me
Showering the starlight, a veil so thin and so bright
Hate just becomes a word, no meaning, no force

If I was strong I could be a man
Holding your hand for all
I'd face the world alone, I'd build on your walls
But I'm only half a man

If I was strong I could be a man
Holding your hand for all
I'd face the world alone, I'd build on your walls
But I'm only half a man
