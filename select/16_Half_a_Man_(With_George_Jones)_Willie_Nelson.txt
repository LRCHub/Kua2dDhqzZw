If I'd only, had one arm to hold her
Better yet if I had none at all
Then I wouldn't have two arms that ache for you
And there'd be one less memory to recall

If I'd only had one ear to listen
Oh, to the lies that she told to me
Then I would more closely resemble
The half a man that she made of me

And if I had born with but one eye
Then I don't leave, have one eye to cries
And if half my heart turned to ashes
Maybe half of my heartaches would die

If I'd only had one leg to stand on
Then a much truer picture she'd see
For then I more closely resemble
The half a man that she made of me
The half a man that she made of me
